# # Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project explores the prediction of diabetes using various machine learning models. After rigorous analysis, the top-performing models are:

Logistic Regression (After Hyperparameter Tuning):
Accuracy: ~82%
ROC-AUC Score: ~86.38%
Random Forest (Univariate Feature Selection):
Test Accuracy: ~77.27%
ROC-AUC Score: ~75.86%
These models demonstrate strong predictive capabilities, with the tuned Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC score.
